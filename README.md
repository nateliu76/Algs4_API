# Algs4_API

This project is in collaboration with the authors of the textbook [Algorithms 4th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Edition-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X) to expand their library of algorithm API's

[Their official site](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

[The page for the API's](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/)

The material is also used with the Algorithms courses at Princeton University, and the popular MOOC [Algorithms I](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI), and [Algorithms II](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII)



API's that are already published on the site:

* [Dijkstra's SP in undirected graph](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/DijkstraUndirectedSP.java.html)

* [Eulerian path in undirected graphs](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/EulerianPath.java.html)
* [Eulerian cycle in undirected graphs](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/EulerianCycle.java.html)
* [Eulerian path in directed graphs](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/DirectedEulerianCycle.java.html)
* [Eulerian cycle in directed graphs](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/DirectedEulerianPath.java.html)

API's that are finished but under review:

* Binary search with extra functions (first/last index of, floor/ceiling, predecessor/successor, count, etc.)

* Pairing Heap

* Pairing Heap with index

* Range Minimum Query using Cartesian Tree

* Utility class that verifies graph properties
